            <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
              Max Ferguson is a doctoral student in the Engineering Informatics Group within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. He currently studies how machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used optimize manufacturing processes.
            </p>
            <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
              Max grew up in New Zealand where he received Bachelor of Engineering in Civil and Environmental Engineering. In 2014, he was awarded a Fulbright Graduate Fellowship to investigate how computational techniques, such as machine learning, could be applied to structural damage prediction, which became the focus of his work at Stanford University. After completing a M.S at Stanford in 2016, his research focus shifted toward optimization and automation in the manufacturing industry.
